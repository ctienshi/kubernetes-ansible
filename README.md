# Kubernetes Cluster using Ansible

* Clone repository.
* Create multiple centos8 servers. One master and many worker. Use vagrant like [here](https://github.com/edib/many_vagrant_machines)
* Change the “ad_addr” in the env_variables file with the IP address of the Kubernetes master node.
* Run the following command to setup the Kubernetes Master node.

```bash
ansible-playbook setup_master_node.yml
```

* Once the master node is ready, run the following command to set up the worker nodes.

```bash
ansible-playbook setup_worker_nodes.yml
```

* Once the workers have joined the cluster, run the following command to check the status of the worker nodes.

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

## Additional information

* The IP addresses of the workers and masters added to the /etc/hosts file on all workers and masters as part of the [prerequisites.yml](centos/playbooks/prerequisites.yml) playbook,
if necessary or in case of DNS issues make sure the addresses have been added to /etc/hosts file.
